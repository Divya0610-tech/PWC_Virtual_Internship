# PWC_Virtual_InternshipRecently, I completed the PwC Switzerland’s job simulation on Forage, where I worked on several key projects that expanded my skills and knowledge in data analysis. These projects focused on call center trends, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion analysis. Each project offered valuable insights and hands-on experience that have enriched my understanding of these critical areas.

I’d like to share the three projects I completed and the key takeaways from each.

Project 1 - Call Center Trend
I received a request from Claire, the Call Centre Manager at PhoneNow, to design a Power BI dashboard that would creatively present the key metrics and KPIs in their dataset. Claire emphasized the need for creativity.

The task was to develop a dashboard that would clearly display essential KPIs, such as customer satisfaction, call response and abandonment rates, time-based call breakdowns, average answer speed, and a performance quadrant comparing average handle time against the number of calls answered.
