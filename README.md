# PWC_Virtual_Internship
Recently, I completed the PwC Switzerland’s job simulation on Forage, where I worked on several key projects that expanded my skills and knowledge in data analysis. These projects focused on call center trends, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion analysis. Each project offered valuable insights and hands-on experience that have enriched my understanding of these critical areas.

I’d like to share the three projects I completed and the key takeaways from each.

# Project 1 - Call Center Trend
I received a request from Claire, the Call Centre Manager at PhoneNow, to design a Power BI dashboard that would creatively present the key metrics and KPIs in their dataset. Claire emphasized the need for creativity.

The task was to develop a dashboard that would clearly display essential KPIs, such as customer satisfaction, call response and abandonment rates, time-based call breakdowns, average answer speed, and a performance quadrant comparing average handle time against the number of calls answered.

# Key Insights:

Call Volume: The total call volume was 5,000 calls.

Abandoned Calls: Out of the total, 946 calls were abandoned, indicating a potential area for improvement in customer wait times and service efficiency.

Answered Calls: 4,054 calls were answered, reflecting the call center’s capacity to manage a high volume of incoming calls.

Resolved Calls: Of the answered calls, 3,646 were resolved, showcasing a strong problem-solving capability within the team.

Average Pickup Speed: The average pickup speed was 57.52 seconds, indicating that while the response time is reasonable, there may be room for optimization to enhance customer experience.

Average Call Duration: The average call duration increased notably during the peak period from 11am to 1PM, likely due to higher call volumes and more complex issues being addressed. Despite this, the majority of incoming calls were related to streaming topics, with technical support and other issues following, indicating that the nature of the calls also contributed to longer handling times.

Staffing: The call center was staffed by 8 agents.

Calls per Agent: With a total of 5,000 calls, each agent handled approximately 625 calls. This workload distribution suggests a high level of activity for each agent, emphasizing the importance of monitoring agent fatigue and performance to maintain quality service.

Average Satisfaction Rating: The average customer satisfaction rating was 3.40 out of 5, which suggests that while customers are generally satisfied, there is room for improvement in delivering a more exceptional service experience.
# Project 2 - Customer Retention Analysis
The EDA involved exploring the dataset to answer several key questions, such as:

What is the total number of customers?

What is the churn rate?

What is the retention rate?

What are the average monthly charges?

Are there any significant trends in customer demographics?

# Key Findings:

Customer Demographics: The dataset comprises 7,043 customers, with males representing 50.5% (3,556) and females 49.5% (3,487).

Retention and Churn: The retention rate is 73.46%, while the churn rate stands at 26.54%.

# Insights:

Gender Distribution: The nearly equal split between male and female customers suggests a balanced customer base. However, further analysis could identify gender-specific preferences or pain points affecting retention differently.

Retention vs. Churn: While a 73.46% retention rate is positive, the 26.54% churn rate indicates a significant portion of customers leaving. Understanding the reasons behind this churn should be a priority.

Revenue Insights: The total charges and average monthly charges indicate moderate customer spending. It’s important to explore whether these charges are perceived as fair and if there are opportunities to increase value without causing dissatisfaction.

# Project 3 - Diversity and Inclusion Analysis
# The EDA focused on answering the following key questions:

What is the total number of current employees?

How many employees left the organization in the past year?

What are the demographics of new hires, particularly by gender and age?

How many employees were promoted, and what is the gender breakdown of those promotions?

How do performance ratings differ by gender?

What is the distribution of employees by job type (full-time vs. contract)?

What is the overall turnover rate, and what does it indicate about the organization’s retention strategies?
